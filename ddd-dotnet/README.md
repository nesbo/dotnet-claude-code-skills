# Domain-Driven Design for .NET

A comprehensive Claude Code skill for implementing Domain-Driven Design patterns in .NET applications.

## What This Skill Covers

This skill provides production-proven patterns and practices for implementing DDD in .NET, including:

- **Core Building Blocks**: Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate Command and Query responsibilities
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clean separation between domain and infrastructure
- **Repository Pattern**: Write and Query repositories with proper abstraction
- **Command/Query Handlers**: Using Paramore.Brighter and simple services
- **Time Control**: Deterministic time handling with IClock
- **Domain Exceptions**: Proper error handling
- **Unit of Work**: Transaction management

## Key Features

- Real-world code examples from production systems
- Quick reference templates for common patterns
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Clean architecture principles
- Testable domain logic
- SOLID principles applied

## Based On

This skill is based on real production code from the LMP project, implementing modern .NET practices with:

- C# 12 features (primary constructors, collection expressions)
- Entity Framework Core
- Paramore.Brighter for CQRS
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design tactical patterns

## Usage

When working on .NET projects with Claude Code, this skill helps you:

1. Design clean domain models
2. Implement CQRS pattern correctly
3. Separate concerns between domain and infrastructure
4. Write testable, maintainable code
5. Follow production-proven patterns
