# Using .NET Claude Code Skills with Claude Code

This repository contains production-ready DDD skills designed specifically for use with Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude.

> **Universal Applicability**: While explained using C# and .NET, these patterns apply to any object-oriented programming language (Java, TypeScript, Python, etc.). The principles of DDD and hexagonal architecture are language-agnostic.

## What This Repository Provides

This is a **skills library** for object-oriented development with Claude Code, focusing on:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** patterns (language-agnostic principles)
- **Data Persistence** implementations (demonstrated with one ORM approach)
- **BDD-Style Unit Testing** with in-memory database support
- **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) patterns
- **CQRS** command and query separation
- **Production-tested code** from real-world projects

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a **reference and pattern library** for Claude Code when working on object-oriented projects. The skills contained here provide:

1. **Comprehensive documentation** of DDD, data persistence, and unit testing patterns
2. **Code templates** for common scenarios (in C#, adaptable to other languages)
3. **Best practices** and anti-patterns to avoid
4. **Quick reference guides** for implementation
5. **Production-proven examples** from real projects

## How to Use with Claude Code

### Option 1: Install as Plugins (Recommended)

You can install these skills as plugins directly in Claude Code using the `/plugin` command:

```bash
/plugin add https://github.com/nesbo/dotnet-claude-code-skills
```

This will install all available skills (ddd-dotnet, data-dotnet, bdd-dotnet, and add-serena) from this repository, making them immediately available in your Claude Code sessions.

**To install individual skills**, you can specify the skill name:

```bash
/plugin add https://github.com/nesbo/dotnet-claude-code-skills:ddd-dotnet
/plugin add https://github.com/nesbo/dotnet-claude-code-skills:data-dotnet
/plugin add https://github.com/nesbo/dotnet-claude-code-skills:bdd-dotnet
/plugin add https://github.com/nesbo/dotnet-claude-code-skills:add-serena
```

**To remove plugins**:

```bash
/plugin remove ddd-dotnet
/plugin remove data-dotnet
/plugin remove bdd-dotnet
/plugin remove add-serena
```

**To list installed plugins**:

```bash
/plugin list
```

### Option 2: Reference Skills Directly

When working with Claude Code on your .NET project, reference skills from this repository:

```
"Using the patterns from dotnet-claude-code-skills/ddd-dotnet, create a new aggregate for Product"

"Following the data-dotnet skill, implement the repository for Product"

"Using the bdd-dotnet skill, write unit tests for the CreateProduct command handler"

"Review this code against the patterns in dotnet-claude-code-skills"
```

### Option 3: Clone Locally for Reference

Clone this repository to have the skills available as reference material:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nesbo/dotnet-claude-code-skills.git
cd dotnet-claude-code-skills
```

Then reference the skills in your Claude Code sessions by providing the path to the skill files.

### Option 4: Copy Patterns into Your Project

Copy relevant skill documentation into your own project's documentation folder for project-specific reference.

## Architecture Context

These skills implement **Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Adapters (Infrastructure)     │
│   - Web API                     │
│   - Blazor Apps                 │
│   - Data Persistence     ◄──────┼─── data-dotnet/
│   - Service Clients             │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
              ▲
              │ implements
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Ports (Domain Layer)          │
│   - Aggregates & Entities ◄─────┼─── ddd-dotnet/
│   - Command Handlers            │
│   - Query Handlers              │
│   - Repository Interfaces       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
              ▲
              │ tests
              │
      ┌───────────────┐
      │  Unit Tests   │ ◄──────────────── bdd-dotnet/
      └───────────────┘
```

**Key Principle**: The domain layer (ports) defines interfaces. The infrastructure layer (adapters) implements them. Dependencies flow inward. Tests verify domain behavior using real repositories.

## Implementation Stack

These skills are demonstrated using:

- **.NET 8+** with C# 12 (primary constructors, collection expressions)
- **One ORM approach** for data persistence examples
- **NUnit 3+** for unit testing examples
- **Paramore.Brighter** for CQRS command handling (one implementation approach)
- **PostgreSQL** examples (patterns work with any database)

The underlying DDD and hexagonal architecture patterns apply to any OOP language and technology stack.

- Alternative ORM implementations
- Other language implementations (Java, TypeScript, Python)

Follow the existing format when adding new skills:
1. Create a new folder with descriptive name
2. Add `SKILL.md` with comprehensive documentation
3. Add `README.md` with overview
4. Update main `README.md` to reference the new skill
